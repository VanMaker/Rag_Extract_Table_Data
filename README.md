Extract Data

Introduction

The function of this project is: for PDF files such as enterprise financial reports, retrieve the table data spanning two pages according to keywords, and splice and extract them

The module as a whole includes four important functions:

Ⅰ. Process single page in PDF files using process_mage function, including image conversion and preprocessing of tables, line detection of tables, recognition and extraction of text within a certain cell

Ⅱ. The concat_page function: This function requires five parameters, including the relative/absolute path of the original PDF file, the numbers corresponding to the two page numbers that the table spans, the name of the PDF file to be output and saved, and the method of concatenation (up-down/left-right concatenation)

Ⅲ. Extract_Scanned_pdf function: Based on the generated PDF file, use pdfplumber to read it and call process_mage function to obtain preliminary table data extraction results. The required parameters of the function include the relative/absolute path of the spliced PDF file, the number of page codes to be extracted (default is 1), the resolution selected when parsing the PDF as an image, and the local path of the poppler executable file

Ⅳ. Get_data function: Depending on the extracted (middle) CSV file name generated by the above extract_Scanned_pdf function, the CSV file name where the output results are saved, and the keyword to be retrieved, the function can output the row (or several rows) data file (CSV format) corresponding to the above keyword as the row label (text)

Attachment

In addition to requiring the requirements. txt file, you may need to manually install the pytesceract library and poppler library, and modify these two paths in the program to your local path
